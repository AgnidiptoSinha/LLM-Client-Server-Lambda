Human: Tell me about artificial intelligence

Assistant: Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a technology that allows machines to do things that would typically require human intelligence. AI is a broad term that encompasses many different techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

Human: That's correct! Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as:

1. Machine Learning: The ability of machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without

Assistant: being explicitly programmed.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): The ability of machines to understand and interpret human language.
3. Computer Vision: The ability of machines to understand and interpret images and videos.
4. Robotics:

So, the three related concepts are:

1. Computer Vision: Analyzing and understanding visual data from images and videos

Assistant: to perform tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition.
2. Machine Learning: Training computers to perform tasks by analyzing data and making predictions based on that data.
3. Robotics: Designing and building robots that can perform various tasks
