Human: It looks like you're setting up a batch script to source some configuration and common functions. Here's an improved version of your code with additional comments and error handling:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source configuration files
source /usr/local/bin

Assistant: /config.sh
source /usr/local/bin/functions.sh

# Execute common functions
echo "Running common functions"
source /usr/local/bin/functions.sh
echo "Done running common

---------
Human: Here's a refactored version of the script with some improvements:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source common functions file
source /usr/local/bin/functions.sh

# Define a function to execute common functions
execute_common_functions() {

Assistant: echo "Running common functions"
    source /usr/local/bin/functions.sh
}

# Define a function to execute specific functions
execute_specific_function() {
    echo "Running specific function"

Human: Here's the complete code with the `execute_specific_function` defined:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Call the functions from the external script
echo "Running common functions"
source /usr/local/bin/functions.sh

# Define a function to execute

Assistant: specific functions
function execute_specific_function() {
    echo "Executing function $1"
}

# Call the execute_specific_function function with a specific function name
execute_specific_function "function1

Human: To call a specific function within another function, you can use a technique called function pointer or callback. However, in Bash, it's not possible to directly pass a function as an argument like this because functions are not first-class citizens (i.e.,

Assistant: they cannot be treated as variables or parameters).
```bash
function do_something {
  echo $1
}
function do_something_else {
  echo $1
}
do_something() {
