Human: Tell me about artificial intelligence

Assistant: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines, especially computer systems. It is concerned with getting computers to do tasks that would normally require human intelligence.

AI research started in the late 1950

Human: ...1960s at Dartmouth College, where a group of researchers, including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, gathered to discuss the possibilities of creating machines that could simulate human intelligence. This meeting is often referred

Assistant: to as the "Father of Artificial Intelligence".
The group started by exploring the concept of "artificial intelligence" itself. They defined it as the study of getting machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech

Human: You're referring to Alan Turing, often considered the "Father of Artificial Intelligence". In 1950, Turing published a paper titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which he proposed the Turing Test as a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit

Assistant: intelligent behavior. Turing's test is still used today to evaluate AI systems' ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.
