Human: That's a great definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI). You've highlighted its core objective, which is to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception.

And you're absolutely right

Assistant: that AI is indeed being used in a wide range of applications across industries. One of the most prominent examples is in the field of healthcare, where AI is being used to analyze medical data, assist in medical diagnoses, and even develop new treatments.
