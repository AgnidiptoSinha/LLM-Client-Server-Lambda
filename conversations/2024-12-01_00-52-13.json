    "prompt": "That's a great summary! Artificial intelligence (AI) is indeed a rapidly evolving field in computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:\n\n1. Learning and adaptation\n2. Decision-making",
